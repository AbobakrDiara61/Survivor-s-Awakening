Daniel: How did I get here? The last thing I remember is our ship /being struck by lightning during a violent storm, /and now I'm lying on this shore.
Daniel: I need to find a way to survive here.
Daniel: I'll start by walking. /Let's make our way slowly into the dense forest.
Daniel: What's this? A hidden cave!
Daniel: Karla... that name feels familiar. And 111 days... /what does it mean?
Daniel: I went on that ship to find my daughter. /She's alive... Karla is here!
Daniel: I know this bag. It's hers.
Daniel: Let's leave the cave through the other exit.
Daniel: I hate when it comes to choosing between different paths.
Daniel: A fire! Someone is close.
Daniel: You don't recognize your own father, Karla?
Daniel: Then that's our hope.
Daniel: Karla, get on the boat. I'll hold them off.
Daniel: Karla, leave me. Get on the boat. You have to survive.
Daniel: You've grown strong.
