To whoever finds this,
If you’re reading this, I’m either gone or I’ve found a safer place to hide. Many people end up stranded on this island. Take the food, but be careful—there are killers here. They almost caught me several times. They travel with dogs, and I’ve seen them near this area.
My name is Karla. I was on a sailing trip. I have a father; I’m his only daughter.
If you plan to survive, please… try to find me.
