Daniel: How did I get here? The last thing I remember is our ship being struck by lightning during a violent storm, and now I’m lying on this shore.
Daniel: I need to find a way to survive here.
Daniel: I’ll start by walking. Let’s make our way slowly into the dense forest.
Daniel: Let’s search the shore for plants or food, then head into the forest.
Daniel: What’s this? A hidden cave!
Daniel: Karla… that name feels familiar. And 111 days… what does it mean?
Daniel: I went on that ship to find my daughter. She’s alive… Karla is here!
Daniel: I know this bag. It’s hers.
Daniel: Let’s leave the cave through the other exit.
Daniel: I hate when it comes to choosing between different paths.
Daniel: A fire! Someone is close.
Daniel: You don’t recognize your own father, Karla?
Daniel: Then that’s our hope.
Daniel: Karla, get on the boat. I’ll hold them off.
Daniel: Karla, leave me. Get on the boat. You have to survive.
Daniel: You’ve grown strong.
Karla: You’re one of them, aren’t you? First, you try to kill me, and now you steal from my camp?!
Karla: Ha… my father? That’s not possible. You expect me to believe that? Tell me how to escape this place, or I’ll shoot!
Karla: Dad… how did you get here?!
Karla: I found a way out. There’s a boat on the far side of the island, but I can’t reach it alone.
Karla: That’s them—their dogs. We have to move. Now!
Karla: You said no sacrifices. That includes you.
Karla: Stop saying that. I didn’t come all this way to lose you now.
Karla: You showed me how.
